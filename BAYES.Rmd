## BAYESIAN STATSTISTICS

This is a guide to help me learn Bayesian statistics.

the following equation is simply adding up the values for the binomial distribution for every value of k from 1 to n for a p of 0.00720

```{r}
pbinom(0,100,0.00720,lower.tail=FALSE)
```

## The Probability Density Function Plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
xs <- seq(0.005,0.01,by=0.00001)
plot(xs,dbeta(xs,300,40000-300),type="l",lwd=3,
     ylab="density",
     xlab="probability of subscripton",
     main="PDF Beta(300,39700)")
```
